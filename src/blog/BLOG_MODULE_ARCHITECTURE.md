## Data Flow Patterns

### Content Creation Flow
1. Admin creates blog post (draft)
2. Admin creates associated polls
3. Admin publishes blog post
4. Users can read content and participate in polls

### User Engagement Flow
1. User reads published blog post
2. User answers associated polls
3. System awards XP based on performance
4. User receives feedback and notifications
5. Progress tracked in user history

### Learning Integration
